<p><strong>User Channels Layer:</strong> - Web App – Provides platform
access for players, coaches, and venue operators - Mobile App – Provides
platform access for players, coaches, and venue operators - Admin
Console – Provides platform administration and oversight
capabilities</p>
<p><strong>API and Business Logic Layer:</strong> - Platform Backend –
Exposes platform capabilities, enforces access control and business
rules, and coordinates with domain services</p>
<p><strong>Core Domain Services Layer:</strong> - Booking &amp;
Scheduling Service – Manages activity bookings, scheduling, and conflict
resolution - Venue Management Service – Manages venues and availability
schedules - Activity Management Service – Manages publication,
discovery, and participation tracking</p>
<p><strong>Integration Layer:</strong> - Payment Integration Adapter –
Handles optional payment processing integration with external payment
providers - Notification Integration Adapter – Manages user
notifications about bookings, changes, and cancellations</p>
<p><strong>Data Layer:</strong> - Platform Data Store – Single
centralized logical data store containing all user, venue, activity, and
participation data</p>

coaches and tournament organizers to create and publish sports
activities (training sessions, matches, tournaments) linked to specific
venues and time slots. Supports definition of activity details, capacity
constraints, and participation rules for different activity types,
including multi-session tournaments with coordinated scheduling.</p>
<p><strong>Activity Discovery &amp; Booking</strong> – Provides
participants with capability to search, discover, and view available
activities with visibility of activity details, current capacity status,
and booking status. Enables participants to book activities subject to
availability and eligibility constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Participation &amp; Cancellation Management</strong> –
Manages participant enrollment and participation lifecycle including
confirmation workflows, capacity enforcement (enrollment until capacity
is reached), and cancellation handling. Supports identification of
affected participants and notification of changes.</p>
<p><strong>Historical &amp; Upcoming Activity Visibility</strong> –
Provides all user roles with visibility into upcoming scheduled
activities and historical records of completed activities, participation
status, and activity outcomes to support planning and analysis.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.5.4" id="high-level-flows"><span class="header-section-number">2.5.4</span> High-Level Flows</h3>

Discovery (REQ-11)</h4>
<p>A player visits the platform, registers with appropriate profile
information, and creates a personal profile. The player then searches
for available training sessions based on preferences or filters and
views detailed information about discovered activities including
schedules, venues, coaches, and current enrollment status.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.5.4.2" id="coach-activity-publication-req-12"><span class="header-section-number">2.5.4.2</span> Coach Activity Publication
(REQ-12)</h4>
<p>A coach accesses the platform, selects a venue with available time
slots, creates a new training session with details (schedule,
description, capacity limits, participation rules), and publishes the
activity. The activity becomes discoverable to eligible players.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.5.4.3" id="player-enrollment-and-capacity-management-req-13"><span class="header-section-number">2.5.4.3</span> Player Enrollment and
Capacity Management (REQ-13)</h4>
<p>Players discover and enroll in published activities. The system
tracks enrollment and enforces capacity limits, preventing overbooking.
When an activity reaches capacity, further enrollment is blocked or
placed in a waitlist (handling of waitlists is an open question).</p>
<h4 data-number="2.5.4.4" id="venue-availability-updates-req-14-req-36"><span class="header-section-number">2.5.4.4</span> Venue Availability Updates

<h2 data-number="2.7" id="integration-architecture"><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Integration Architecture</h2>
<h3 data-number="2.7.1" id="external-systems"><span class="header-section-number">2.7.1</span> External Systems</h3>
<p><strong>Payment Provider</strong> – Third-party payment processing
service enabling optional online payment functionality. Integration is
optional and supports transaction processing, payment status tracking,
and confirmation notifications.</p>
<p><strong>Notification Service</strong> – Third-party service providing
user communications about bookings, activity changes, cancellations, and
other relevant events via email, SMS, push notifications, or other
channels. Integration is required for user communications.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.7.2" id="integration-responsibilities"><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2</span> Integration
Responsibilities</h3>
<p>The Platform Backend orchestrates integration with external
services:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Payment Integration Adapter handles communication with the
Payment Provider for optional payment processing. The specific payment
model (direct payment, escrow, platform fee handling) is an open
decision.</p></li>
<li><p>The Notification Integration Adapter handles communication with
the Notification Service for sending booking confirmations, activity
changes, and cancellation notifications. Specific notification channels
(email, SMS, push) and delivery guarantees are open decisions.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="2.7.3" id="interaction-patterns"><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3</span> Interaction Patterns</h3>
<p>User channels (web and mobile) interact with the core Platform
Backend for all activity discovery, booking, profile management, and
venue management operations. The Platform Backend delegates business
logic to domain services and coordinates with external services as
needed to fulfill transactions and communicate with users.</p>
<hr />
<h2 data-number="2.8" id="security-architecture"><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Security Architecture</h2>
<h3 data-number="2.8.1" id="authentication-and-authorization"><span class="header-section-number">2.8.1</span> Authentication and
Authorization</h3>
<p>The platform must implement role-based access control (RBAC) ensuring
that users can only access and modify data appropriate to their role.
Authentication mechanisms must verify user identity before granting
access.</p>
<p>The platform supports four distinct user roles (Players, Coaches,
Venue Operators, Platform Administrators) with role-based permissions
governing what capabilities each user can access and what data they can
view or modify.</p>
<p><strong>Open Question:</strong> Detailed RBAC matrices and permission
models for each role have not been defined in the inventory and require
stakeholder input.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.8.2" id="data-protection-and-privacy"><span class="header-section-number">2.8.2</span> Data Protection and
Privacy</h3>
<p>The platform must protect user data according to applicable
regulations. Personal information including user profiles, contact
details, and participation history must be handled according to data
protection principles.</p>
<p><strong>Open Question:</strong> Specific applicable regulations
depend on deployment geography (GDPR for EU, CCPA for California, etc.)
and require clarification during design phases.</p>
<hr />
<h2 data-number="2.9" id="implementation-teams"><span class="header-section-number">2.9</span> Implementation Teams</h2>
<p>The following teams are responsible for translating the Solution
Outline into implementation:</p>
<p><strong>Product and Requirements Team</strong> – Responsible for
validating business requirements, clarifying ambiguous policies (booking
conflicts, eligibility rules, cancellation policies), and working with
stakeholders to define open business decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture and Design Team</strong> – Responsible for
translating objectives into detailed logical architecture, designing
data models, defining system integrations, and ensuring alignment with
constraints (cloud deployment, independent scaling, compliance).</p>
<p><strong>Development and Engineering Team</strong> – Responsible for
implementing the platform across all functional capabilities,
integrating external services, and ensuring technical compliance with
non-functional requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Operations and Support Team</strong> – Responsible for
defining operational procedures, support models, maintenance workflows,
and governance for the platform (implied by requirements but not yet
detailed).</p>
<hr />
<h2 data-number="2.10" id="non-functional-requirements"><span class="header-section-number">2.10</span> Non-Functional
Requirements</h2>
<h3 data-number="2.10.1" id="responsiveness-and-near-real-time-visibility"><span class="header-section-number">2.10.1</span> Responsiveness and Near
Real-Time Visibility</h3>
<p>The platform must provide near real-time visibility of schedules,
availability, and participation status updates across all users. The
specific definition of “near real-time” (acceptable latency thresholds
in seconds or minutes) requires stakeholder clarification and will be
documented in detailed specifications.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.10.2" id="scalability"><span class="header-section-number">2.10.2</span> Scalability</h3>
<p>The platform must support independent scaling of different functional
areas to accommodate growth in users, activities, and data volume over
time. This enables the platform to evolve with additional sports and
advanced features without architectural redesign.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.10.3" id="reliability-and-availability"><span class="header-section-number">2.10.3</span> Reliability and
Availability</h3>
<p>The platform must operate reliably as a central hub for sports
activity coordination. The criticality of the platform as a single point
of coordination implies high reliability expectations. While specific
availability targets and SLAs are not defined, the platform’s role in
enabling coordination across all stakeholders makes reliability a
critical quality attribute.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.10.4" id="data-protection-and-compliance"><span class="header-section-number">2.10.4</span> Data Protection and
Compliance</h3>
<p>The platform must comply with applicable data protection and privacy
