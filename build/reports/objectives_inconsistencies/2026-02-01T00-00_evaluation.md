# Requirements Inventory vs Solution Outline Objectives – Consistency Report

## Executive Summary

The Solution Outline Objectives document demonstrates strong alignment with the Requirements Inventory. The evaluation identified **2 minor issues** related to terminology consistency and scope clarification:

- **1 Terminology Mismatch:** "Reliability and Availability" in Objectives is not explicitly mapped to inventory items, though implied by REQ-28 and REQ-31.
- **1 Scope Clarification:** Out-of-Scope statement regarding "Offline modes or mobile-specific features" adds interpretation not explicitly present in inventory, though consistent with REQ-16.

**Overall Assessment:** ✓ ACCEPTABLE – Objectives faithfully derive from inventory with consistent coverage and appropriate assumption handling.

## Issues Table

| IssueId | Severity | Category | Location | Description | Evidence | SuggestedFix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OBJ-INV-001 | Minor | Missing Req-ID Mapping | Non-Functional Requirements: Reliability and Availability | Objective introduces "Reliability and Availability" as a Non-Functional Requirement but does not explicitly map to specific inventory item. | Inventory contains REQ-28 (improve visibility, reduce conflicts) and REQ-31 (support evolving needs and integrations) which imply reliability/availability needs, but no explicit requirement captures "reliability" or "availability" as quality attributes. The objective is inferred rather than stated. | Add explicit reference to implied inventory sources: "The platform must operate reliably as a central hub for sports activity coordination. This reliability objective is implicit in REQ-28 (enabling data-driven planning) and REQ-31 (supporting evolving needs), though specific availability targets and SLAs are not defined in the inventory." |
| OBJ-INV-002 | Minor | Scope Clarification | Scope Definition: Out of Scope – "Offline modes or mobile-specific features" | Objectives exclude "Offline modes or mobile-specific features beyond basic web/mobile channel access" but inventory does not explicitly state this exclusion. | REQ-16 states "Interaction with end users through web or mobile digital channels" without specifying offline capability or mobile-specific features. The out-of-scope statement interprets inventory intent but adds clarification not explicitly present. | Clarify by modifying the statement: "Offline modes or mobile-specific features beyond basic web/mobile channel access (as implied by REQ-16's focus on digital channels, though not explicitly excluded in inventory)." Or reference inventory note: "REQ-16 does not specify offline modes or mobile-specific optimization." |

## Detailed Findings

### Coverage Assessment

**Overall:** Comprehensive and complete. All 36 inventory items are mapped to objectives sections.

**Coverage Verification:**
- Business Capabilities (REQ-01–06): ✓ Mapped to 6 Functional Objectives
- Actors/Stakeholders (REQ-07–10): ✓ Mapped to Stakeholders section + Teams Involvement
- Business Flows (REQ-11–15, REQ-36): ✓ Mapped to 5 High-Level Flows
- System/Interfaces (REQ-16–18): ✓ Mapped to Systems Identified + Integrations & Data Flow
- Data/Information (REQ-19–22): ✓ Mapped to Data Domains
- Constraints/Policies (REQ-23–26): ✓ Mapped to Constraints section
- Non-Functional Intents (REQ-27–31): ✓ Mapped to Business Context, Objectives, and Non-Functional Requirements
- Risks/Open Points (REQ-32–35, REQ-36): ✓ Mapped to Risks and Questions section

**Requirements Coverage Map Validation:** All 36 items are explicitly listed in the Requirements Coverage Map with traceability to objectives sections. Status shows "Covered" for all items.

### Scope Creep Assessment

**Overall:** Minimal scope creep. Objectives faithfully reflect inventory without significant additions.

**Analysis:**
- **In-Scope Capabilities** – All 7 in-scope capabilities directly correspond to Business Capability items (REQ-01 through REQ-06) plus External Integrations (REQ-17, REQ-18).
- **Out-of-Scope Statements** – Four exclusions are listed. Three are explicitly justified or implied by inventory:
  1. "Detailed financial management" – Justified by REQ-33 (payment models not specified) and inventory scope.
  2. "Competitive ranking, tournament scoring" – Justified by REQ-34 (governance rules not fully specified).
  3. "Direct management of operational responsibilities, support tickets" – Justified by REQ-35 (operational responsibilities not assigned).
  4. **"Offline modes or mobile-specific features"** – This is the one where objectives add interpretation. REQ-16 specifies "web or mobile digital channels" but does not explicitly exclude offline modes. This is a minor scope clarification rather than significant creep.

### Alignment Assessment

**Overall:** Strong alignment between inventory descriptions and objectives translations.

**Evidence:**
- Business Capability descriptions in Objectives match inventory items closely and extend appropriately into goal-oriented language.
- Flows derived from Business Flow/Scenario items (REQ-11–15, REQ-36) describe logical sequences consistent with inventory scenario descriptions without prescribing implementation.
- Data domains align with Data/Information inventory items without over-specifying technology or structure.
- Integration requirements clearly reference System/Interface items (REQ-16–18).

### Assumption Handling

**Overall:** Excellent – Objectives properly record ambiguities as assumptions rather than resolving them.

**Examples of Proper Assumption Handling:**
- REQ-04 eligibility criteria → Assumption #1: "Eligibility Rules"
- REQ-05 cancellation policies → Assumption #3: "Cancellation and Refund Rules"
- REQ-30 "near real-time" definition → Assumption #5: "Real-Time Latency Thresholds"
- REQ-34 tournament governance → Assumption #6: "Tournament Governance"

All 10 documented assumptions in the Objectives Assumptions section correspond to ambiguities and open points noted in the inventory.

### Terminology Consistency

**Overall:** Consistent terminology with one minor mapping issue.

**Analysis:**
- Inventory terms like "Business Capability," "Actor/Stakeholder," "Business Flow/Scenario" are used consistently in objectives.
- Objectives section titles are descriptive rather than type-based (e.g., "Functional Requirements (as Objectives)" instead of "Business Capabilities"), which is appropriate per template guidance.
- Vocabulary alignment is strong (e.g., "role-based access control" consistently used, "participation management" consistently referenced).

**Minor Issue OBJ-INV-001:**
- Objectives introduce "Reliability and Availability" as a Non-Functional Requirement without explicit inventory Req-ID.
- This is inferred from REQ-28 (improve visibility, reduce conflicts, enable reliable data) and REQ-31 (support evolving needs), but the term "availability" as a specific quality attribute does not appear in inventory.
- The objective is justified and appropriate, but mapping to source inventory items should be explicit.

### Team Involvement Mapping

**Note on REQ-10 (Platform Administrators):**
- Inventory REQ-10 identifies administrators as stakeholders.
- Objectives map this to "Teams Involvments" section (note the typo "Involvments" instead of "Involvements" in objectives, which is replicated from template).
- This is a minor labeling inconsistency (stakeholder vs team), but functionally appropriate since administrators are both users and implied operational team.

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Address Before Use)
None – No critical issues identified.

### Priority 2 (For Documentation Clarity)
1. **OBJ-INV-001:** Explicitly reference source inventory items in "Reliability and Availability" objective. Modify text to: "This reliability objective is implicit in REQ-28 (improve visibility and reliable data) and REQ-31 (support evolving business needs)."

2. **Terminology Note:** Update "Teams Involvments" to "Teams Involvement" in the objectives header (matches template, but template also contains this typo).

### Priority 3 (For Future Reference)
- Maintain the Requirements Coverage Map as a living document when objectives are updated.
- Ensure any additions to objectives explicitly reference source inventory items.

## Conclusion

The Solution Outline Objectives document successfully derives all objectives from the validated Requirements Inventory with strong consistency and complete coverage. The two identified issues are minor and relate to explicit mapping clarity and scope clarification, not fundamental misalignment or missing coverage.

Objectives appropriately:
- Map all 36 inventory items to logical objective sections
- Record ambiguities as assumptions rather than resolving them
- Avoid introducing solution design or implementation details
- Maintain traceability through the Requirements Coverage Map

**Overall Assessment:** ✓✓ ACCEPTABLE – Ready for use as authoritative objectives baseline.
