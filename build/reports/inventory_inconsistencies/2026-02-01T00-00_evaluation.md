# Requirements Inventory vs BRD – Consistency Report

## Executive Summary

The Requirements Inventory successfully captures 35 distinct requirements extracted from the BRD across 8 classification types. The evaluation identified **3 issues** requiring attention:

- **1 Missing Item:** The BRD implies a requirement for coordinate/sync between venue availability and activity scheduling that is partially addressed but could be more explicit.
- **1 Misclassification:** REQ-30 (near real-time visibility) could be considered a Non-Functional Requirement (performance/responsiveness) rather than a business intent.
- **1 Scope Ambiguity:** The inventory includes assumptions about eligibility criteria (REQ-04) not explicitly stated in the BRD, introducing scope beyond the source document.

## Issues Table

| IssueId | Severity | Category | Location | Description | Evidence | Suggested Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| INV-BRD-001 | Minor | Missing Item | Inventory | Missing explicit requirement for consistency/synchronization between venue availability updates and activity booking constraints. | BRD Section 7 describes "venue operator updates to availability reflected in activity scheduling" (REQ-14) but does not address collision resolution or cascading effects when availability is reduced post-booking. | Consider adding REQ-36: "Business Flow / Scenario – System must handle synchronization of venue availability changes with existing bookings and provide conflict resolution strategy (e.g., cancellations, rebooking options)." Source: Section 7 implications. |
| INV-BRD-002 | Minor | Misclassification | REQ-30 | REQ-30 classified as "Non-Functional Intent" but better characterized as "Non-Functional Requirement (Performance/Responsiveness)." | Description states: "Platform should provide near real-time visibility..." – this is a performance/responsiveness quality attribute rather than a business intent or outcome goal. | Consider reclassifying REQ-30 from "Non-Functional Intent" to "Non-Functional Requirement" or adding a new category for performance/quality attributes if not already present. |
| INV-BRD-003 | Minor | Scope Ambiguity | REQ-04 | Inventory item introduces "eligibility criteria" concept not explicitly addressed in the BRD. | BRD Section 6 states "Discovery and booking of available activities by eligible participants" but does not define what determines eligibility (e.g., skill level, registration status, prior participation). | Clarify in inventory notes that "eligible participants" is an open concept requiring stakeholder definition; it is not a BRD-derived constraint but an inventory interpretation. Alternatively, consider adding REQ-36: "Constraint / Policy – Eligibility rules for participation in activities (skill levels, prerequisites, registration requirements) require definition." |

## Detailed Findings

### Completeness Assessment

**Overall:** The inventory achieves strong completeness across major BRD sections.

- **Section 1 (Introduction):** Scope and intent captured implicitly in Non-Functional Intent requirements (REQ-27, REQ-29, REQ-31).
- **Section 2 (Business Context):** Pain points and motivation captured in REQ-27 and REQ-28.
- **Section 3 (AS IS Current State):** Implicitly addressed through the transition narrative in Non-Functional Intents.
- **Section 4 (TO BE Target State):** Fully captured in Business Capabilities (REQ-01 through REQ-06) and supporting data/interface requirements.
- **Section 5 (Key User Groups):** Fully captured in Actors/Stakeholders (REQ-07 through REQ-10).
- **Section 6 (Core Business Capabilities):** Fully captured in Business Capabilities (REQ-01 through REQ-06).
- **Section 7 (Activity Scenarios):** Fully captured in Business Flows/Scenarios (REQ-11 through REQ-15).
- **Section 8 (Systems and External Parties):** Fully captured in System/Interface requirements (REQ-16 through REQ-18).
- **Section 9 (Constraints and Considerations):** Fully captured in Constraint/Policy requirements (REQ-23 through REQ-26).
- **Section 10 (Risks and Open Points):** Fully captured in Risk/Open Point requirements (REQ-32 through REQ-35).

**Strengths:**
- All major business capabilities are captured.
- User roles and scenarios are completely represented.
- External integrations and constraints are identified.
- Open points are explicitly tracked.

**Gaps:**
- No explicit requirement for conflict resolution or availability synchronization strategy (INV-BRD-001).

### Consistency Assessment

**Overall:** Internal consistency is strong with minor classification and scope issues.

**Consistency Findings:**
- No duplicate or overlapping items detected.
- All requirements appropriately traced to BRD sections.
- Ambiguities documented with appropriate caveats.
- Classification types are generally appropriate and consistently applied.

**Minor Issues:**
- REQ-30 classification (INV-BRD-002): Better treated as Non-Functional Requirement rather than Intent.
- REQ-04 scope (INV-BRD-003): Introduces "eligibility criteria" interpretation requiring clarification.

### Classification Quality

**Appropriate:** 32 of 35 requirements are well-classified per business intent and type.

**Questionable:**
- **REQ-30** – Currently "Non-Functional Intent" but describes a performance/responsiveness characteristic (near real-time). Better as "Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)."

### Scope Alignment

**Within Scope:** 34 of 35 requirements directly derive from BRD content.

**Scope Extensions (Acceptable with Caveats):**
- **REQ-04** – Introduces "eligibility criteria" concept not explicitly detailed in BRD. Noted in inventory but warrants explicit call-out that this is an inventory interpretation requiring stakeholder clarification.

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Address Before Proceeding)
None – all issues are minor clarifications.

### Priority 2 (Address Before Finalization)
1. **INV-BRD-001:** Consider adding an explicit requirement for availability synchronization and conflict resolution to ensure completeness.
2. **INV-BRD-002:** Reclassify REQ-30 or update classification taxonomy to distinguish between intent-based and performance-based Non-Functional Requirements.
3. **INV-BRD-003:** Enhance REQ-04 notes to explicitly state that eligibility criteria are not BRD-defined and require stakeholder input.

### Priority 3 (For Future Refinement)
- Consider adding a "Non-Functional Requirement" classification category separate from "Non-Functional Intent" to better distinguish quality attributes from outcome goals.
- Add a cross-reference matrix linking inventory requirements to specific BRD paragraphs for traceability.

## Conclusion

The Requirements Inventory demonstrates strong coverage and consistency against the BRD. The identified issues are minor and primarily relate to clarification opportunities rather than errors. The inventory successfully provides a structured foundation for subsequent architectural objectives and detailed specifications.

**Overall Assessment:** ✓ ACCEPTABLE WITH MINOR CLARIFICATIONS
